= Lecture 12: CPU Overview

Before examining the Central Processing Unit (CPU), lets talk about instructions.

== Instructions

Instructions encode operations for the CPU to perform.
They consist of, at minimum, an opcode (a code to indicate what operation to perform).
We can broadly categorize instructions into 3 categories:

. Arithmetic and Logic operations (e.g., ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, AND, OR, NOT)
. Control flow operations (e.g., conditional JUMP or unconditional GOTO)
. Data movement operations (e.g., LOAD, STORE, MOV)

Just as functions typically have parameters, instructions typically have operands.
Usually, instructions have between 0 to 3 operands, inclusive.
Operands come in several formats (addressing modes):

Direct address:: The operand is a number referencing a register (most common).
Immediate address:: The operand is data literally in the instruction.
Indirect address:: The operand is a number referencing a register, which in turn references a location in memory.

== CPU categories

CPUs can be broadly categorized along several dimensions:

* Where does the CPU fetch instructions and data?

Harvard architecture:: the CPU loads instructions from a ROM (read-only memory), and data from a separate RAM (random-access memory).
Von Neumann architecture:: the CPU loads instructions and data from one RAM.

* Where do instructions fetch operands?

Stack machine:: Operands are pushed and popped to/from a stack (e.g., JVM, CLR)
Register machine:: Operands are from registers (e.g., Intel x86, ARM)

* To what extent do instructions vary?

RISC:: Reduce Instruction Set Computing (instructions are uniform in length with minimal variation in format; e.g., ARM, JVM)
CISC:: Complex Instruction Set Computing (instructions vary in length and format; e.g., Intel x86)

NOTE: The distinctions among the categories above are blurring as CPUs in one category adopt features of the other category.
For example, most modern CPUs use a stack to call functions and return values, but use registers for arithmetic operations.

== CPU components

Like software, CPUs are typically split into several components, which we will examine in turn.

=== Instruction register

The instruction register (IR) holds the current instruction.
In Harvard architecture CPUs, the instruction comes from a ROM; whereas in Von Neumann CPUs, instructions and data come from RAM.

=== Instruction decoder

The instruction decoder splits the current instruction into its constituent parts (i.e., opcode and operands).
In RISC CPUs, the decoder is usually trivial; whereas in CISC CPUs, variations in instruction length complicate decoding.

=== Program counter

The program counter (PC) is a register that references the memory address of the current instruction.
By default, the CPU increments the program counter after executing each instruction.
However, jump instructions will set the PC directly.
Unconditional jump instructions change the PC without performing a comparison (hence the name).
Conditional jump instructions typically set the PC if the comparison is true, and increment if false.

=== CPU Phase

At a high level, a small state machine (typically a counter) determines which "phase" of operation the CPU is in.
Typically, the phases consist of these operations in sequence:

. Fetch instruction from memory (RAM) and store into the instruction register
. Decode instruction into constituent parts (opcode, and operand(s))
. Fetch operand(s) (data)
. Execute instruction
. Write result
. Advance program counter (instruction pointer)

=== Bus control

The bus control is a combinational logic circuit (i.e., stateless circuit) responsible for moving data.
The bus control fetches instructions, operands, and implements data movement instructions.

=== ALU

The Arithmetic / Logic Unit (ALU) is a combinational logic circuit responsible for arithmetic and logic.
An ALU typically has two inputs, a and b, along with the operation to perform on it (the opcode).
The ALU output is the result of applying some operation on the two inputs.
ALUs are typically arranged such that the opcode is the select line of a large multiplexer.
The inputs to the multiplexer are the various operations applied to the same two inputs a and b.

=== Register file

Register machines have a register file: a place to access several registers.
Register files can read two registers and write one register simultaneously.
To access two registers simultaneously, we have two multiplexers to select the contents of the registers of interest.
To write to a register, we use a demultiplexer to send a write signal to one of many registers.
A demux is like a multiplexer in reverse: it has one input and multiple outputs, and the select line chooses which output to send the input to.

=== Stack

Practically all CPUs have a stack to for function call and return.
However, some CPUs (typically virtual machines such as the JVM or CLR) use a stack instead of a register file for arithmetic and logic operations.
In such machines the ordering of instructions must be postfix (as opposed to infix).
In infix, there is an order of operations (parentheses are sometimes necessary), and operations are placed between operands.
In postfix, there is no order of operations (parentheses are never necessary!), and operations are placed after operands.

For example, the infix expression `1 + 2 * 3` evaluates to 7.
By order of operations (PEMDAS), we first multiply 2 and 3, then add 1.
In postfix, the equivalent expression is `2 3 * 1 +`, and it also evaluates to 7.
Note that the postfix expression corresponds to how we evaluate the infix expression.
That is, we push 2 then 3 on the stack.
Multiply pops these values off the stack and places 6 on the stack.
Then we push 1 on the stack.
Plus pops 6 and 1 off the stack and pushes 7 on the stack.

As another example, consider the infix expression `-b + sqrt (b*b - 4 * a * c) / 2 * a`.
By order of operations, we evaluate the numerator first, then the denominator.
Within the numerator, we evaluate the parenthesized expression first.
In postfix this expression is:
`b b * 4 a c * * - sqrt -b + 2 a * /`
That is, we push b on the stack twice.
Multiply replaces the stack contents with `b*b`
We push 4, a, and c on the stack and multiply twice.
The top of the stack is `4*a*c` and the bottom is `b*b`.
The subtract operation subtracts the top from the bottom.
The stack is now `b*b-4*a*c`
Sqrt replaces the top of the stack with the sqrt of the top of the stack.
Push negative b and then add, we have the numerator.
Finally, we multply 2 and a and finally divide.
