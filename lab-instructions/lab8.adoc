= Lab 8 onward: CPU project

Build a CPU in Logisim and test it with machine code.

The CPU should be programmable, but the data and program do not need to share the RAM.
That is, the program could be in a separate ROM (read only memory) to simplify things.

== Lab 8

Goal: find a partner or partners.

Ideally, work in pairs.
Working on this individually is *very* challenging and not recommended.
Groups of 3 are okay, but larger groups are not recommended.

== Lab 9

=== Part 1
Goal: Set up your repository.

. Everybody on your team: https://github.com/new[Create a private repository for your CPU]
. Copy the SSH clone URL from the web site
. Do this:

        cd
        git clone SSH_URL_FROM_GITHUB_BUT_DONT_TYPE_THIS_IN_LITERALLY

. Add my repo as upstream

        git remote add upstream https://github.com/lawrancej/CPU-2014.git
        git pull upstream master

. Add `lawrancej` as a collaborator (Repo settings -> collaborators)
. Add each of your friend(s) as collaborators to your repository.
. Add your friend(s) SSH urls to git.

		git remote add myFriendBob ssh_url_to_my_friend_bobs_rep_url_dont_type_this_literally

=== Part 2
Goal: Decide on the parameters of your CPU.

You may work on an existing CPU, including the one I supplied, but in that case,
you need to clearly explain what you did to improve it.
The best way to do this is to commit the existing CPU in your repository first
and explain that it is your starting point.

Example CPUs include:

* http://minnie.tuhs.org/Programs/UcodeCPU/index.html[UcodeCPU]
* http://minnie.tuhs.org/CompArch/Tutes/week03.html[Tutes]
* http://db.grinnell.edu/sigcse/sigcse2013/Program/viewAcceptedProposal.pdf?sessionType=paper&sessionNumber=39[Simple CPU]
* https://github.com/briandef/bf16[Brainfuck]

Answer these questions, but remember, you will need to write a demonstration program for this CPU.
The easier it is to implement the CPU, the harder it may be to write demonstration code.

==== Architecture

Is this CPU a Harvard architecture or von Neumann architecture?

NOTE: A Harvard architecture CPU (where program is in ROM and data is in RAM) is
simpler to implement with few (if any) consequences on machine code complexity.

==== Instructions

Decide on an instruction set.

The CPU *must* support at minimum: conditional jumps, increment, decrement, and loading and storing data to RAM.
Examples include: Brainfuck, [Nibbler](http://www.bigmessowires.com/nibbler/), 6502, [jvm](http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/)

* How many instructions do you plan to implement?
* What are they? (Keep in mind, some machines only implement a handful of instructions)
* What is the maximum number of operands an instruction may have? (Usually, this is no more than 3)
* How many bits will you use to encode each instruction?
* Are instructions a fixed width? (It is far easier for it to be fixed width, btw)

==== Registers

How wide are the registers? 8 bits? 16 bits? 32 bits?

How many registers do you plan to implement in the register file?

Machines without a register file exist: they use stacks instead (see http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/about.html[JVM assembly]).
Obviously, a register is still necessary to keep track of where we are in the stack, but in a "stack machine" the register isn't referenced directly as an operand.
Instead, push and pop operations implicitly change the stack register.

One register machines also exist: they use a single pointer in an array (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck[Brainfuck]).

Early Intel machines only had 2 identifiable registers, A and B.

Supporting multiple registers arguably simplifies machine coding, but large register files are tricky to implement.

== Lab 10
Goal: Implement the fetch/execute cycle state machine, instruction decoder, ALU, register file, bus control, program control.

Hint: Split work up into separate circuits and test them independently.

== Lab 11
Goal: Continue Lab 10. Merge components together.

Informal progress updates from every team is necessary.

== Lab 12

Goal: Prove your CPU works by implementing some simple program for it.

For example:

* Guess the number
* Fibonacci sequence
* Hailstone sequence
