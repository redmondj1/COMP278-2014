. Answer these questions about the state machine above.
.. How many bits for state will you need?
.. How many input bits will you need?
. Then, map states to bits, and map inputs to bits.
. Write out a state-transition table.
. Convert the state-transition table into the appropriate logic expressions.
. Finally, using either the appropriate gates, or the equivalent MUX configurations, implement this as a circuit in Logisim.
